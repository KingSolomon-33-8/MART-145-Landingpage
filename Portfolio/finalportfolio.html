	<h2>My Website</h2>
	<p>I created a website that highlights my passion for the outdoors, hence the name I gave
	my site, '<a href="index.html">Solomon Outdoors</a>'. I live for hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing, and anything outdoors
	I really enjoy HTML and CSS. They seem to make a lot of sense to me and it doesn't take very
	long to get the hang of it. The elements are pretty straight forward and assigning certain
	attributes also seems straight forwards. Once you understand how the structure of your Website
	operates and works, it is kind of just a game of memorizing which pieces go where and what things
	are called. W3Schools took a little getting used to and felt overwhelming at first, but that also
	quickly became easy to navigate and follow along. Even now I still go back and review certain elemtents,
	attributes, styles, etc... when I get stuck. I love it. Overall I am happy with how much I learned this
	semester and I am excited to continue to learn and add to my website with HTML and CSS.</p>

	<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
	<p>Bootstrap is an interesting tool, I am a perfectionist and I enjoy creating my own things even if it is 
	harder. I can see the benefit, especially if you do not have time to learn all the ins and outs of HTML
	and CSS, especially cause doing it all from scratch can get messy. I enjoyed messing around with an already
	complete webpage. Also I loved the icons option, I wish they had more options. I still am trying to figure
	out how to add my graphic design as a logo on MY website. Hopefully I can soon. anyways, I think that
	bootstrap is an interesting tool that seems quick and easy. However, I do know that a group of programmers
	on the internet have claimed bootstrap "dead", stating that it is obsolete, generic, and rigid. I think
	for me, I will stick with just using HTML and CSS, open minded of course. Who knows I might find that there
	is more to bootstrap than I thought. Here is the <a href="bootstrap.html">bootstrap</a> theme I messed around with.</p>

	<h2>My Quiz</h2>
	<p>I made this <a href="quiz.html">quiz</a> using html, css, and a little bit of javascript. I do not know a whole lot
	of javascript, so, I needed a tiny help. I got it working and I am happy with it, a little cheesy
	but fun. I might add it to the website, and now that I know how to use forms and that javascript
	works in the html flawlessly, I might think up some cool ideas for my webpage! I love how I was
	able to use my knowledge of python and 'if then' statements to attach html files to the users answer
	on the quiz. At first I thought I would have to have a database or something that counted all the values
	together in a separate file... I am so glad that I was wrong and there was a simpler fix.</p>
