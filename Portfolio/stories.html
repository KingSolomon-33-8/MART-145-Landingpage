<h2>My Biggest Deer</h2>
<p>After nine years of hunting and seven deer harvested, I finally shot a big one. in 2023
I frequented my spot in the western part of the state. One morning, more then half way through
the season, my uncle and I ventured out into the vast big sky country to find ourselves a shooter.
It was the rut so theoretically the big bucks should be up on their feet moving, checking does.
We were on some awesome bucks at first but they were not on public, they were just over the fence
one was a HUGE Montana Whitetail, the other was a decent but mean buck looking for trouble. We
watched them most the day but they eventually petered off into the fields. After many failed attempts 
of getting a chance at a nice buck, we found a stomper, two actually. We got into position for a 300 
yard shot on one of the two shooters headed up the draw our way. But right when they reached the fence
to public they layed down with their backs against the barbed wire. Defeated, we sat in silence, with
a sliver of hope that for some reason the bucks would jump the fence from their saftey, food, water,
and herd to come up to the empty plains and hills that we were set up at. Yep, these guys were not going
anywhere. Not without some devine intervention. It was nearing dusk when I proposed the idea to my 
experienced uncle Jon to sneak around our hill down into the same draw they lay, on the opposite side of
the fence and start banging antlers together and calling to the bucks to get their attention. It was a long
shot in the dark but I could not sit there watching my dream slip away from me. So we left our backpacks on
the hill and creeped our way down to the bucks, our wind was good, there was a roll to the draw that provided
some cover, now we just needed the deer to get up from their comfy beds and come check out the decieving sound
of two massive bucks fighting with everything they got, or me just rattling in other words... They were bedded
about 150 yards from us, after some calling and banging the smaller of the two stood up. He looked our direction
and hopped the fence, I could not believe it, it was happening and I knew this was a gift from God. It was gonna
be a very close shot so my confidence was high. He walked all the way in looking for the two stoic bucks who were
fighting in the draw. Because we left our backpacks on the hill, I could not use one to prop myself up so that I
could see over the grass. So I decided to shoot free hand, which I had never done in my nine years of hunting.
So, I lifted my uncles 6.5 284 Norma up to my shoulder looked down the sight and squeezed the trigger... BANG!
I could not believe it, I was in shock, there was no way that just happened to me... I missed. I missed my chance,
I missed that big deer only seventy yards away and he ran up into the hills, my dream, my want, my desire on four
legs sprinting into the horizon. Defeated my calm unlce instructed me to keep rattling and he was bleating for the
other buck, the bigger buck. I still had not processed what just happened when I saw the second buck jump the fence.
In disbelief I shoved my face into my hands, I tried to hand the gun to my uncle so he could shoot it, but he was
not goning to let me not shoot that deer. So, I got into a prone position, barley being able to see through the 
tall grass, and saw the buck strutting through the draw, I gasped so loud that the buck heard me and stopped. I 
set my crosshairs right behind his shoulder and squeezed the trigger. At only eighty yards the grass had little to
no effect on my bullet flying through the crisp and cold Montana air. The bullet struck and the deer ran about twenty
yards and tipped over, crashing to the ground. He died how he lived, hard, intense, ruthlessly. An awesome wave came
over my uncle and I as we embraced in victory after hours of hard work, but the hard work was just starting. We walked
up onto the heavy buck, and I remember so clearly what my unlce Jon said, "That's a WALLHANGER DUDE!". I was absolutley
shocked, happy, proud, thankful, and electric about the experience. Once we began field dressing and caping my deer, I
noticed a brown dot on the hill, it was almost dark but still shooting light. "Is that a deer?" I said confused at the
thought of a deer coming down to a kill site. My uncle grabbed the gun and I grabbed the camera and we got set up. It
was the buck a I shot and missed, I ranged it, He was about 300 yards away, My uncle took the shot and the deer took
off towards the fence and expired right at the edge of the fence. It was truly awesome, the bucks resembled each other
almost like they were brothers. I was still wearing my gutting gloves for the picture with his buck. We packed our deer
out and had tons of food and awesome trohpies to remember this hunt for the rest of my life. The cool part is my uncle
ended up shoulder mounting it for me and it is on the wall next to me as I write this. He is an old deer, with split
eye gaurds, he also has a broken G3 on his left side, and he is a 140 caliber deer. I am thankful for my uncles help
and guidance and so grateful and blessed by my God above for the incredible experience and memeory I will cherish with
me forever. That is the story of the biggest buck of my life so far.</p>

<h2>Faith's First Deer</h2>
<p>It was the day before Thanksgiving 2023, we headed north to get my then girlfriend, Faith her first deer! She already had lots of tries
 at deer that year and but none successful. We could only hunt until early afternoon that day because we had to get back in time to help
her mother clean for Thanksgiving. We made the 3 mile hike in and saw a few deer, but we had not had a chance to capitalize on any of them
until around noon Faith's brother Austin, shot a whitetailed doe that ran over a hill, we pursued it and saw a couple of hunters quartering
a big buck, which was demoralizing. Austin harvested his doe and him, his dad, and brother began to quarter it. Faith asked if it would be
alright if her and I went back over the hill to look for a deer, her dad said it was fine and we wandered back over the hill. Faith was very
negative about the whole year, saying things like "I am never going to get a deer." " I guess God doesn't want me to get my deer." I knew she
was just down about being so close to harvesting a deer but also being so far. I was determined to change that. We got to a good spot that we
could see and sat down to glass, she took a nap and I got distracted by how cute she looked. Finally she woke up and asked if we could go back
and I proposed to stay "Just a few more minutes." When out of nowhere a rutting buck chased a doe right onto public! We were both shocked but
knew they were too far to shoot and it would take us forever to get to them. By the grace of God, the buck bedded the doe and we both decided
to make our move. We got up and took off down the hill, there were no trees to hide behind so we had to use the topography of hills and draws
to hide from sight. I was so nervous that the deer would see us, Faith had to stop and pee, and I lost sight of the deer. Things felt intense
but I did not want to stress out the shooter. We got to a gully and believe or not there was a buck we spooked out of the gully, I just pressed
on knowing that our buck was still bedded with the doe. We made it to about 500 yards from the deer when we would be in their sight if we continued
any further, so we got on our hands and knees and crawled. Faith dropped her backpack because it was hard to crawl with her bag and her gun. I 
carried my backpack for her to shoot off of incase the grass was too tall. We made to 350 yard crawl to around 150 yards away. I could now see
the bucks antlers and the does eyes, they stood up because they were aware that something was happening. Faith set the gun on my bag and got set
to shoot. The buck turned broadside and I whispered "Faith shoot when you are ready." through the adrenaline and excitement she let the .243 bullet
fly across the field into the deer. I saw that the shot was low, "Shoot again!" I begged. Faith was new to hunting, and shooting, but she prepared
for this moment and was aware of how to use the gun effectively. However, the first time killing an animal is not as perfect as you would like it to
be. She shot again and missed, then a third time and hit it in the other leg, finally she shot it again and hit it in the diaphragm. But it still 
would not expire. Exhausted, I ran as fast as I could back to her bag she dropped and grabbed the extra ammunition we brought. I sprinted back and
totaled 1000 yards in about 2-3 minutes. She was crying which I think is healthy when you wound an animal, but it happens and I did not want her to
feel too bad. So, I handed her a couple rounds and she put 2 more into the buck to make sure it was done. Finally we could celebrate! It was not the 
prettiest and even now writing this I want to keep the ugly out, but that is reality, and sometimes we have to have the hard conversations in life.
The good news is, what felt like an eternity to us, was only a few moments. When we got to the buck Faith was ecstatic about her first buck! I was
so incredibly proud of her. The unique thing about her bucks antlers was that the bases were 5.5 and 6 inches in circumference and the eyegaurds were 
so wild! Just a wonderful first buck. While we packed the buck out with her brother Ryan, Austin, and her Dad, I remember talking about all the cool
things on my mind that day with the moonlight on my face, when I noticed I was the only one talking... So, I stopped talking. Praise the Lord for that
 day, and thanks to her family for helping us pack it out those 3 miles. Faith has since shot many rounds and is amazingly accurate with a rifle now.
 I am proud to share this moment, and proud of her personal growth as a hunter and a person.</p>
